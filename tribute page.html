<div class="listheader"><strong> Here's a timeline of Osagyefo's life:</strong></div>
<div class="listdiv">
	<ul>
		<li><b>Kwame Nkrumah,</b> born on <time datetime="06-21-1909">september, 21<sup>st</sup>, 1909</time> to a retail trader (the mother)and a goldsmith (the father). His name was Francis Nwia-Kofi Ngonloma.</li>
		<br>
		<li>Raised a Roman Catholic,<b> Kwame Nkrumah</b> attended Catholic day schools and graduated from Achimota College in <b>1930</b>. A few years later, he moved to the United States to pursue master’s degrees at Lincoln University and the University of Pennsylvania. While in the U.S.,<b> Nkrumah’s</b> exposure to Marxist, socialist, and Black nationalist thought influenced his politics.
</li>
<br>
		<li>He also immersed himself in political work, reorganizing and becoming president of the <b>African Students’ Organization</b> of the United States and Canada. He left the United States in <b>May 1945</b> and went to England, where he organized the <b>5th Pan-African Congress</b> in Manchester.
</li>
<br>
<li>Meanwhile, in the Gold Coast, ,<b>J.B. Danquah</b> had formed the <b>United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC)</b> to work for self-government by constitutional means.<em> Invited to serve as the UGCC’s general secretary, Nkrumah returned home in late <b>1947</b></em>. As general secretary, he addressed meetings throughout the Gold Coast and began to create a mass base for the new movement. When extensive riots occurred in <b>February 1948,</b> the British briefly arrested Nkrumah and other leaders of the UGCC</li>
<br>

<li>When a split developed between the middle-class leaders of the UGCC and the more radical supporters of Nkrumah, he formed in <b>June 1949</b> the new <b>Convention Peoples’ Party (CPP),</b> a mass-based party that was committed to a program of immediate self-government. In <b>January 1950,</b> Nkrumah initiated a campaign of “positive action,” involving nonviolent protests, strikes, and noncooperation with the British colonial authorities
</li>
<br>

<li>In the ensuing crisis, services throughout the country were disrupted, and<b> Nkrumah</b> was again arrested and sentenced to one year’s imprisonment. But the Gold Coast’s first general election <b>(February 8, 1951)</b> demonstrated the support the CPP had already won. Elected to Parliament, Nkrumah was released from prison to become leader of government business and, in <b>1952,</b> prime minister of the Gold Coast
</li>
<br>
<li>By a plebiscite of <b>1960</b> Ghana became a republic and <b>Nkrumah</b> became its president, with wide legislative and executive powers under a new constitution. <b>Nkrumah</b> then concentrated his attention on campaigning for the political unity of Black Africa.</li>
<br>
<li>He died of cancer in Bucharest in <b>1972.</b></li>
